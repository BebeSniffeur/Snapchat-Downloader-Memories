## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** (recommended) or pip
- **ffmpeg** (optional, for video + overlay composition)

### 1. Clone or download this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Snapchat-Download-Memories.git
cd Snapchat-Download-Memories
```

### 2. Install dependencies

**Using uv (recommended):**
```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install ffmpeg (optional but recommended)
```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 4. Place your HTML file
Create an `html/` folder and place your `memories_history.html` in it:
```
Snapchat-Download-Memories/
├── html/
│   └── memories_history.html  ← Your file here
├── main.py
└── src/
```

### 5. Run the script
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will prompt you with 3 configuration choices:

#### 📁 File Organization
1. **By date (year/month folders)** - *Recommended* - Organized like `2025/12/`
2. **All in one folder** - Everything in `snapchat_memories/` root

#### 📝 Filename Format
1. **20251215_213158** - Compact format *(default)*
2. **2025-12-15_21-31-58** - Readable format
3. **2025-12-15** - Date only (no time)
4. **20251215** - Compact date only

#### 🗜️ ZIP File Processing
1. **Keep everything**: original + separate overlay + composed version *(Recommended)*
2. **Composed only**: final version with overlay only
3. **Original only**: media without overlay
4. **Original + composed**: both versions (without separate PNG overlay)

### 📂 Download Location

By default, all your memories will be downloaded to the `snapchat_memories/` folder in the project directory.

**Want to change the output location?**
Edit the `OUTPUT_DIR` variable in [`src/config.py`](src/config.py):
```python
OUTPUT_DIR = "snapchat_memories"  # Change this to your preferred path
```

You can use:
- Relative paths: `"my_memories"`
- Absolute paths: `"/Users/yourname/Documents/Snapchat"`
- Cloud folders: `"/Users/yourname/Dropbox/Snapchat"`

## 🎯 ZIP File Processing Options

Some memories are exported as ZIP files containing:
- The original media (image or video)
- A PNG overlay (text, drawings, stickers added on Snapchat)

The script offers 4 options at startup:

| Option | Description | Files Created |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **1. Keep everything** | Keeps everything separately + composed version | `_original`, `_overlay.png`, `_composed` |
| **2. Composed only** | Final version only | `20251215_213158.jpg` |
| **3. Original only** | Media without overlay | `20251215_213158.jpg` |
| **4. Original + composed** | Both versions | `_original`, `_composed` |

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

You can modify settings in `src/config.py`:

```python
HTML_FILE = "html/memories_history.html"  # HTML file path
OUTPUT_DIR = "snapchat_memories"           # Output folder
MAX_WORKERS = 30                           # Number of parallel threads
TIMEOUT = 30                               # Timeout per download (seconds)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Script cannot find HTML file
- ✅ Check that the file is in `html/memories_history.html`
- ✅ Make sure you extracted the ZIP received from Snapchat

### Download links expire
- ⚠️ Links in the HTML expire after a few days
- 🔄 Request a new export from Snapchat

### Composed images are not created
- ⚠️ Check that Pillow is installed: `pip install Pillow`
- ℹ️ Without Pillow, only original files and overlays will be saved

### Composed videos are not created
- ⚠️ Check that ffmpeg is installed: `ffmpeg -version`
- ℹ️ Without ffmpeg, only original videos and PNG overlays will be saved

### Error "No module named 'src'"
- ✅ Run the script from the root folder: `python main.py`
- ❌ Don't run from the `src/` folder

### Some files are .dat
- ℹ️ Some files have an unknown format (incorrect Content-Type)
- 🔄 Re-run the script, magic bytes detection should fix them
